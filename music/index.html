    <h2>The Bard's Duty</p2>
        <!--I'd like to get music playing in the background, but with media controls in case a user wants to mute their experience, for whatever crazy reason. Below is written under the assumption that there is no music playing, once I get that added I will want to add early text to advise user to unmute audio if currently muted, it would go perfectly with this page!-->
    <p>Music is a powerful communicator and another hobby of mine so it's natural that a soundtrack was important to the RPG experience I was creating. I started by listening to as many SNES and SEGA RPG soundtracks as possible, and choosing those which best fit the intended mood. This approach was fun but left something to be desired.</p>
    <p>My next goal was to find a way to blend my selected video game soundtracks with a live orchestra. This would also serve as an experience in working with music electronically, not my usual area. I obtained the <a href="http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=SPC">SPC files</a> from a couple of my favorite tracks, converted the files to MIDI, and used LMMS to apply new instruments over existing compositions by giants such as Nobuo Uematsu. While I didn't compose these pieces, I did put in a lot of work to create the final product that I ultimately brought to my table and helped immerse my players in many epic battles.</p>
